This is the repository for the 'CADSketchNet' Dataset, associated with the paper ["CADSketchNet - An Annotated Sketch dataset for 3D CAD Model Retrieval with Deep Neural Networks"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0097849321001333). The paper is accepted for publication in the Special Section on [3DOR2021 - 14th EG 3D Object Retrieval Workshop](https://3dor2021.github.io/index.html) of the [Computers & Graphics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-graphics) Journal. The arxiv version of the paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06212.pdf). The final published version of the paper is [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0097849321001333).

- The CADSketchNet dataset 
	- Dataset-A has 58,696 computer-generated sketches of the 3D CAD models across 68 categories of [MCB](https://mechanical-components.herokuapp.com/)
	- Dataset-B has 801 hand-drawn sketches of the 3D CAD models across 42 categories of [ESB](https://engineering.purdue.edu/cdesign/wp/downloads/)

- *Few images from the Dataset-A (computer-generated sketches) have some missing lines and features. We are currently in the process of cleaning up these sketches. An updated version will be released soon.*
